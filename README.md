Before you do, you need to do the following:
* Design a UML class diagram to solve the problem
	
Since you are confident at SQL, build the database based off the design
	
* Create a blank MVC .NET Core project
* Create a DBContext and model using EntityFrameworkCore
* A customer should be able to view a list of products
* A customer should be able to search for a product they want
* A customer should be able to add a product to their shopping cart
* A customer should be able to checkout (provide delivery details, confirm order) - you can simulate payment
* Process login
* Theme it with bootstrap!
